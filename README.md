## HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI

This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard created in Power BI, designed to provide comprehensive insights into workforce composition, promotion eligibility, and employee service metrics. This dashboard is ideal for HR departments looking to quickly assess employee statistics and make data-driven decisions. The key features include:

- Total Employee Overview: Displays the total headcount, segmented by gender (male/female) for a quick demographic view.

- Promotion Eligibility: Shows how many employees are due for promotion, with a percentage breakdown of those eligible versus those not yet due.

- Service Tenure Analysis: Visual representation of employees’ years of service, helping HR managers understand employee retention and experience levels across the organization.

- Employment Status: Indicates the number of employees currently active (on service) and those who have been retrenched, with percentages to highlight workforce status.

- Distance to Workplace: Provides a segmented view of employee proximity to the workplace (very close, close, and very far), aiding in remote work and commute policy decisions.

- Job Level Breakdown: Offers insights into the distribution of employees, categorized by job levels and gender, to understand representation and hierarchy balance within the 
  organization.

This dashboard leverages Power BI’s visualization capabilities to transform raw HR data into actionable insights, enhancing the ability to make strategic HR decisions effectively.
